# Description

A `JavaScript` demo to simply test your eyes condition.:eye: 



# What can it do?

Test your eyes' condition recently.

- Just press your keyboard's `↑ ↓ ← →` to control the directions.
- If you can't see it, just press the `space` to zoom in.
- If you want to pass the picture, just press the `Enter`.

- It will record your score, but it won't save to your own folder.
- I tried to add voice module(annyang), but the server(it will upload the data to Google Cloud) is out of China, so...
- I tried to add CV module(TensorFlow.js), just use the monitor to detect your gestures. But it failed, I keep on doing that shit, it nearly succeeded, to the last step, it come out with some bugs, which are produced auto. That shit is based on React.js. However, I know nothing about that shit!:angry:



# Why I developed it?

It was a BORING afternoon, so...



# What I really want to say?

- If you are an expert in programming, it might be a joke for you. Just have a fun!:smile:
- Just a toy.:bear: If you really want to care about you eyes,**get away from your computer**:computer: is a better choice!

- How can u have time to see my SUCK demo, do you have plenty of time? If I were you, I will do some sports instead.:soccer:
